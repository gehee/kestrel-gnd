// DISPLAY > Refresh Sync: the screen's refresh held in step with the pictures,
// on the goggle alone. It watches when each picture reaches the renderer, finds
// the vblank position that makes the expected wait least (a picture past the
// commit deadline waits a whole refresh more), and moves the vblank there by
// making frames longer or shorter through the HAL's frame-length control
// (hal/frame_length.hpp; on the RK3568 the VOP2's DSP_VTOTAL_VS_END and its
// undocumented immediate bit).
//
// Per screen ("display_lock_<screen ID>"), off unless turned on, as screens
// differ: the AW3225QF blanks on any change.
//  ON (1): one line at a time, longer only, with the refresh a whole multiple
//      of the camera's frame rate - the BOE1080 takes +1 held and +-1
//      alternating, and blanked on +3 held and on long runs of shorter frames.
//      A "100 fps" camera is not 100.000 (the Lite+ runs 100.13), and against a
//      slower screen this cannot hold.
//  FREE (2): the screen takes any frame length (the CPO1F41 shows 118 Hz, 100
//      Hz... as the total changes, and keeps its picture): each frame is made
//      as long as one camera frame (lines added to the screen's fastest mode,
//      which keeps its quick scan-out), and the phase is moved up to 20 lines
//      a frame either way.
